This project was created using Java and spring on the back end with PGAdmin for my database as well as Vue for my front end

To start you need to create a database named DataEntryApp and open up and run the data.sql file. You will then need to open the backend code in intelliJ and run the server, once the server is running you can go over to vue and open the terminal and run the command npm run serve and you will be directed to http://localhost:8080/ from there you can submit the information and be brought to another page where your info will be confirmed and you will see a table with other data.
